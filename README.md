# 16s Workflow Using Bash Shell, Excel, and R

This workflow was designed for use in the Microbial Ecology Group (MEG) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. It requires use of R (preferably R-Studio... I'm so sorry) version 4.3 or newer, as well as Excel and Bash shell (The Swan terminal, if you are coming from UNO). The first section of this workflow is a DADA2 tutorial from another user, and the rest was edited, created, and compiled by a fantastic professor and myself. If you are having any questions or need to troubleshoot you can reach out to either myself or Dr Ayayee (if you come from the MEG). Happy trails!
